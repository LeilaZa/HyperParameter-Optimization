# Search Algorithms for Automated Hyper-Parameter Tuning in Machine Learning

This code provides a simple HPO implementation (Grid and Random search) for machine learning models, as described in the paper "Search Algorithms for AutomatedHyper-Parameter Tuning in Machine Learning".  

This paper will help users to improve their machine learning models by optimizing their models' hyper-parameter automatically.
